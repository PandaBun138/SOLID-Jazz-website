# Welcome to the SOLID Jazz page!
SOLID Jazz is a club at Whitney High School dedicated to performing jazz music! The club has existed since 2020, so this is our third year on campus! If you play an instrument and is interested in learning jazz music, then this club is perfect for you. You don't have to be enrolled in a music class at Whitney or even play a jazz instrument to join the band. You can join the club by clicking [here](https://forms.gle/gj6mPCMLAC7Lpu3c7).
## What is our goal?
SOLID is actually an acronym! 
- S- Supporters of the music program
- O- One united jazz club
- L- Learners of jazz music and culture
- I- Inspirations to the world
- D- Dedicated to perform to the community

We provide service to our community with our many performances throughout the year! We perform at school concerts, talent show, and the annual district jazz festival at Artesia High School. 
## Rehearsals
Since we do a lot of performances, it means that we have to practice together. These practices are led by our wonderful band teacher and advisor, Mr. Clements. This club is a commitment, so it is crucial that you show up to most of our practices in order to perform. We meet during lunch on Monday and Wednesdays. Each rehearsal lasts only fo 15-20 minutes, therefore it is also highly recommended that you practice the music outside of school.
