# Welcome to the SOLID Jazz page!
SOLID Jazz is a club at Whitney High School dedicated to performing jazz music! If you play an instrument and is interested in learning jazz music, then this club is perfect for you. You don't have to be enrolled in a music class at Whitney or even play a jazz instrument to join the band. 
## What is our goal?
SOLID is actually an acronym! 
- S- Supporters of the music program
- O- One united jazz club
- L- Learners of jazz music and culture
- I- Inspirations to the world
- D- Dedicated to perform to the community

We provide service to our community with our many performances throughout the year! We perform at school concerts, talent show, and the annual district jazz festival at Artesia High School.
